    <h1>Welcome to my github repository</h1>

    <p>I have placed some Python files here to showcase some of the work I have done.</p>

<p>Some of these programs are challenges, some I have just been exploring new libraries. It is an ongoing project.</p>

<p>Challenge websites include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Codewars</li>
    <li>Codingbat</li>
    <li>leetcode.com</li>
    <li>Advent of code</li>
